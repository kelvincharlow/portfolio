# 🚀 Formspree Setup Guide (Super Easy!)

## Step 1: Create Formspree Account
1. Go to [https://formspree.io/](https://formspree.io/)
2. Sign up with your email
3. Verify your email address

## Step 2: Create New Form
1. Click "New Form" in your dashboard
2. Form Name: `Portfolio Contact Form`
3. **Copy the Form ID** (looks like: `mjkvkgnj`)

## Step 3: Update Your Code
In `src/components/contact.tsx`, line 36:
```tsx
const [state, handleFormspreeSubmit] = useForm("mjkvkgnj") // Replace with YOUR form ID
```

Replace `"mjkvkgnj"` with your actual Form ID.

## Step 4: Deploy & Test
1. Commit and push your changes
2. Test the contact form on your live site
3. Check your email inbox for messages
